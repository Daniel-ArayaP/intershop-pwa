# REST based storefront PoC

The proof of concept for a REST based storefront clone of the Responsive Starter Store.

It is supposed to implement the Family Page and the Registration Page as an Angular application based on the according pages from the Responsive Starter Store using only the REST API of the Intershop Commerce Management.

The Family Page will be a playground for testing of paging, SEO, server side rendering, page load optimizations etc.

The Registration Page will feature form handling, validation and interaction with data binding.
